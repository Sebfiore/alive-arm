## ðŸ¤– Alive Arm Project

This Unity project simulates a robotic arm that starts from a fallen position and learns to stand up using reinforcement learning, powered by ML-Agents. The goal is to create lifelike, adaptive behavior where the arm can recover from the ground and eventually learn to move autonomously.

At the current stage, the simulation environment is functional and the robotic arm model is complete. The next step involves designing and training the first ML model to teach the arm how to stand up from the ground.

### ðŸ§  Key Features (Planned)
- Robotic arm with realistic physics and movable base
- Training agents via ML-Agents to learn standing and eventually locomotion
- Step-by-step learning pipeline: **Stand â†’ Balance â†’ Move**
- Modular Unity scene and C# scripts for extensibility

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Unity Engine (2022+)
- ML-Agents Toolkit (vX.X)
- C# for simulation logic
- Python (for training backend)

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
- [x] Design and animate robotic arm
- [ ] Define first training scenario (stand-up task)
- [ ] Train and test standing behavior
- [ ] Expand to movement and navigation tasks

### ðŸš§ Project Status
Early development â€“ arm simulation ready, reinforcement learning pipeline in setup phase.
